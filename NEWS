R.VALUE
=======
* index.freq replaces former index.freq* functions
* Return values unified in one single function (index.rv)
* Added index.spell.mean to compute mean duration of spells (formerly only user-defined percentiles were available)

* Enabled several seasons on same request in jointProbMat.VALUE
* Added new example built-in dataset with deterministic precipitation predictions.
* Renamed built-in datasets to indicate the name of the variable.
