R.VALUE
=======
* Added Mutual Information index for the analysis of joint threshold exceedances
* Bug fix in return value routines
* Internal changes affecting the inputs of auxiliary functions getSeason.VALUE and getYearsAsINDEX.VALUE. These now receive a vector of dates, rather than the whole station/predictions object
* Changes in validation wrapper to compute years for annual aggregations (as required by return value indices, for instance)
* Other minor documentation changes
