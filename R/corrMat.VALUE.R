#' @title Correlation matrix for paper Figures 4 and 5 on spatial validation
#' @description Computes the cross correlation matrices between stations that serve as input for plotting functions
#' @param stationObj An R-VALUE object containing station data (as returned by \code{\link{loadValueStations}}).
#' @param predictions.file Path to the file storing the predictions (passed to \code{\link{loadValuePredictions}}).
#'  Default to NULL, meaning that the correlation matrix is done on the observations.
#' @param season Character string indicating the target season. Accepted values are 
#' \code{c("annual", "DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON")}
#' @param method Correlation method, passed to the \code{\link{cor}} function
#' @param type Type of aggregation in the case of multiple realizations. Should the aggregation of 
#' multiple members be performed \code{"before"} or \code{"after"} computing the correlations?. Ignored
#'  in the case of observations and deterministic predictions.
#' @param max.na.prop Maximum allowed proportion of missing data (Default to 0.25). See details
#' @param deseason Logical. Should the seasonal cycle from the input data series be removed?. See details.
#' @param window.width Used if \code{deseason = TRUE}. Integer number indicating the width, in days, of the window used for
#'  moving average computation of the reference daily climatology. Default to 60 days. See details.
#' @details A (circular) moving average daily climatology can be automatically calculated for each data series, considering 
#' a specific window width (60 days by default, centered around lag 0). This is used for removing the seasonal cycles when applicable. 
#' An additional argument allows to specify the maximum number of missing values allowed, being ommited from the analysis 
#' those data series above the threshold.
#' @return A 2D matrix. Attributes indicate the station names (in the row/column order they appear), and their
#' geographical coordinates.
