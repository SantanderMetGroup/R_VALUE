\usage{
wrapperFUN(metric = c("obs", "pred", "measure"), names = NULL,
  season = c("annual", "DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON"), aggr.type = c("before",

\arguments{
\item{metric}{Character vector.}

\item{names}{Character vector of the same length than \code{metric}. Names of the indices/measures to be applied}

\item{season}{Character vector defining the target season(s). Default to annual + 4 standard seasons.}

\item{aggr.type}{Character vector of length one. Should member aggregation be performed \code{"before"} or \code{"after"} the validation?.
Ignored for observations and deterministic predictions.}

\item{aggr.fun}{Character vector of length one. Multimember aggregation function. Default to \code{"mean"}.}

\item{index.fun}{A character vector with the name of the R function that computes the index.}

\item{measure.fun}{A character vector with the name of the R function that computes the measure.}

\item{index.args}{A list with additional arguments passed to \code{index.fun}. It contains a key-value list for each additional argument.}

\item{measure.args}{Same as \code{index.args} but for the measure function.}

\item{o}{R object containing the observations as returned by \code{\link{loadValueStations}}.}

\item{p}{R object containing the predictions as returned by \code{\link{loadValuePredictions}}.}

\item{na.prop}{Maximum allowable proportion of missing data. Default to 0.9}
