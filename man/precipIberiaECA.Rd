\title{Observations and predictions for precipitation in Iberia}
\format{A list containing two objects of the types (not formally classes) \code{stations.observations}
 and \code{stations.predictions}}
\description{
The object contains two objects, \code{observations} and \code{predictions}
of daily summer precipitation (JJA) for the period 2001-2010,
in a set of 9 ECA stations from the VALUE reference dataset in the Iberian Peninsula.
}
\details{
The predictions have been calculated using NCEP fields of mean daily temperature at 850mb,
sea-level pressure and specific humidity at 850 mb as predictors, and a GLM downscaling approach for
 the training period 1981-2000. Observations data were obtained from the \pkg{R_VALUE} built-in
 dataset \code{VALUE_ECA.zip}. NCEP data and GLM downscaling method implementation is available
 in the \pkg{downscaleR} package.
